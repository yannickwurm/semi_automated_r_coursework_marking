### Question 2: Lint syntax / style guide checking

As covered in class, we fuse lint to ensure that best practices are being respected.

```{r question2_lint}

lint_issues <-lint(filename = "question2.R",
	           linters  = with_defaults(line_length_linter(120)))
lint_issues
length(lint_issues)
```
